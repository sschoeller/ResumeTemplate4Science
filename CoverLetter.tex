Dear \Manager,

\par{
I am a well-rounded professional applying for your \Postitle \ position. I majored in Chemistry, minored in Environmental Studies and added a Computer Science minor in preparation for my master's degree in Computer Science.} %completed experiences in scientific communicaitons I am very detail-oriented and I also take into account the big picture aspects of software development. I design systems from the top-down and then work out the details. Another example of where I was detail-oriented was during my master's thesis. I ultimately designed a novel space-saving algorithm that utilized compression into less computer bits within memory than the original data. 
\par{
I am very thorough regarding analyzing data and writing reports. This skill was essential for my chemistry lab reports, independent study research and computer science thesis.	
}

%\par{
%My Autism Spectrum Disorder has contributed to those successes. 
%A blend of critical thinking, generation of novel solutions and attention to details are what I do best. In my master's thesis, a novel memory space-saving technique was utilized.} 

\par{During my graduate studies, I received recognition from Dr. Donald Knuth, an author of computer science books who has a long-standing challenge considered to be one of the first bug bounty programs. I earned three Knuth Reward Checks for finding errors and suggesting a clarification regarding The Art of Computer Programming, Selected Papers on Computer Science and Selected Papers on Design of Algorithms. Additionally, I have co-presented a PowerPoint slideshow on this experience.
}
%\par{
%I have experience in leadership, tutoring and research roles. Those include being Vice President of the UW--Whitewater chapter of DREAM, tutoring within UW--Whitewater for the Computer Science Department and the Center for Students with Disabilities, being a TA and training co-workers in research techniques. I was co-published three times due to work on chemokines, DAF-16a from B. Malayi, where I also received credit for the structure of the DNA-binding domain, and a cold-shock-like protein from R. rickettsii.
%}

%\par{I strongly support the core value of giving back and I have volunteered for various organizations. These include the Wisconsin Science Festival, Salvation Army, Rock County Humane Society, Rotary Gardens, Milton Public Library and Milton Senior Center.

\par{
I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you about the \Postitle \ role. Thank you for your time and consideration.
