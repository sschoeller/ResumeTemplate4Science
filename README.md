# ResumeTemplate4Science
This is a LaTeX resume/CV template for scientists. Licensed under Creative Commons Zero Universal. 
The rationales behind this project: 
1. Have helpful LaTeX entries for degrees commonly-held by scientists and various universities (mostly "Ivy League" and prestigious science schools); and
2. Have strong formatting features using commonly available packages so that the user doesn't need to fiddle with it to produce something usable (you're more than welcome to, though!).
